## My process

I used vite in creating this practice project. The first thing I did was to analyze the design file and plan how I can implement the components needed. Once I was done with research, I created a vite project and wrote the contents of the html. Then I started regrouping the elements I thought belongs to the same group to make my layout. After that, I added class to the elements, I tried implementing the BEM naming for this project. Then I proceeded with styling. I separated each section with their own css files to avoid clutter and keep the code organized. I used the desktop-first approach and that's when I realized it was a lot more complicated to handle than mobile-first.
